<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Bookmode is a self-hosted, multiuser site that is privacy conscious and designed for a small to medium group of friends to share books in their collections. 

Here's why:
* Bookmode is a tight-nit community for uses looking to share their favs and be introduced to new books that may not have made on their radar. 
* An app for users that believe in privacy, simplicity, and efficiency.
* Large social media platforms are lame and self-hosting is cool. :smile:


### Built With
This project was built using:
* React
* Express
* Sequelize
* Node.js
* Docker
* AuthO for user login
* Material UI
